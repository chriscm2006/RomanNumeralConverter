# RomanNumeralConverter
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chriscm2006/RomanNumeralConverter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chriscm2006/RomanNumeralConverter)

A simple iOS Roman Numeral converter aplication.  My first foray into Swift as well.  May play around with more elements
however for now, only the RomanNumeralConverter module and corresponding test cases are active.  I also set it up on
Travis CI to see how their Mac OSX/iOS integration was coming along.  Seems to be working quite well, once I realized
to stop using the Beta configuration.
