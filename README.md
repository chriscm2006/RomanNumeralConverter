# RomanNumeralConverter
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chriscm2006/RomanNumeralConverter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chriscm2006/RomanNumeralConverter)

A simple iOS Roman Numeral converter aplication.  My first foray into Swift as well.  May play around with more elements
however for now, only the RomanNumeralConverter module and corresponding test cases are active.  I also set it up on
Travis CI to see how their Mac OSX/iOS integration was coming along.  Seems to be working quite well, once I realized
to stop using the Beta configuration.

NOTE: Build is actually working fine.  Travis CI does not like my UI tests.  Seems to we working inconsistently, still can't track down why build 18 failed.  perhaps it was just a glitch.'
